# ReBomb2 - TikTok Mass Report Bot

THIS DOES NOT GAURANTEE A BAN. STILL UP TO TIKTOK, THIS JUST INCREASES THE CHANCES OF THE RIGHT PERSON SEEING THE REPORT OR CONFUSING THE AI THAT SUPPOSEDLY CONTROLS THE REPORTING.

PROXIES WILL BE ADDED SOON AS I'VE HEARD FROM MANY PEOPLE THAT THIS WOULD WORK BETTER WITH PROXIES. FREE PROXIES DON'T WORK SO I WILL HAVE TO USE PAID ONES WHICH I WILL BE GETTING SOON

Copy the Request URL and make sure it's the right one by pasting the url in your browser. It should say "Thank you for your feedback"

Paste the request URL in the Rebomb and hit enter

You should get a bunch of "Thank you for your feedback" messages as the software will send the request over and over again.  Make sure you're using a VPN in case you get IP banned for sending all of these requests
