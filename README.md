# ReBomb2 - TikTok Mass Report Bot

MAJOR DISCLAIMER: I WILL NEVER IN MY LIFE CHARGE YOU TO USE THIS. THERE IS NO GUARANTEE THAT THIS WOULD EVEN WORK SO IF ANY FAKE BIORAT OR ANYONE TRIES TO SELL YOU THIS, IT'S NOT ME. MY PROGRAMS ARE LITERALLY ME BEING BORED AND SHOOTING THE PISS. IF YOU WANT TO DONATE, COOL BUT THE REBOMB2 WILL REMAIN FREE AND OPEN SOURCE 

THIS DOES NOT GAURANTEE A BAN. STILL UP TO TIKTOK, THIS JUST INCREASES THE CHANCES OF THE RIGHT PERSON SEEING THE REPORT OR CONFUSING THE AI THAT SUPPOSEDLY CONTROLS THE REPORTING.

UPDATE: PROXIES HAVE NOW BEEN ADDED! DOWNLOAD THE ZIP FILE "REBOMB2APPWITHPROXIES" Scroll down to the "Rebomb2App" application inside the folder, make a shortcut if you want to and it should start!

Copy the Request URL and make sure it's the right one by pasting the url in your browser. It should say "Thank you for your feedback"

Paste the request URL in the Rebomb and hit enter

You should get a bunch of "Thank you for your feedback" messages as the software will send the request over and over again.  Make sure you're using a VPN in case you get IP banned for sending all of these requests
